<p> So you want to get started on your journey as a gamedev? Well, it's frankly not as easy as it looks. First of all, what do you want in your game? Well throw those thoughts 
out the window. When you're starting off, you have to start small, like really small. You want to create a game that functions first. All the fancy stuff like graphics and 
such can be implemented at a later date. First of all, do you know how to code? And by know how to code, I mean fully understand the conditions and limitations of the language as well as 
all the basics? And second of all, is the language you know viable to create games? Most modern games are coded off of C++, and some are coded off of C# with C++ as a backend. 
The reason why? It's because C++ is notorious for being fast. The user experience has to be sharp, snappy, and responsive or it can to lead to feelings where the user feels 
like they aren't in control due to poor optimization. Since you're a beginner, you have the choice between two main engines that most modern games run off of, and those being Unity
and Unreal Engine. Both are really capable engines, with Unity being utilized in more Indie games and Unreal being mostly used by massive studios creating games that focus more on fidelity. 
This doesn't mean that Unity can't churn out high fedelity games or Unreal cannot produce amazing 2D games as both are perfectly capable. However, once you get started, you're going to get overwhelmed.
For a beginner, I would recommend the utilization of Unity, as many say the learning curve of Unity is less that of Unreal.
