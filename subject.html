<h2>So You Want To Get Started?</h2> 
<br>

<p> So you want to get started on your journey as a gamedev? Well, it's frankly not as easy as it looks. First of all, what do you want in your game? Well throw those thoughts 
out the window. When you're starting off, you have to start small, like really small. You want to create a game that functions first. All the fancy stuff like graphics and 
such can be implemented at a later date. First of all, do you know how to code? And by know how to code, I mean fully understand the conditions and limitations of the language as well as 
all the basics? And second of all, is the language you know viable to create games? Most modern games are coded off of C++, and some are coded off of C# with C++ as a backend. 
The reason why? It's because C++ is notorious for being fast. The user experience has to be sharp, snappy, and responsive or it can to lead to feelings where the user feels 
like they aren't in control due to poor optimization. Since you're a beginner, you have the choice between two main engines that most modern games run off of, and those being Unity
and Unreal Engine. Both are really capable engines, with Unity being utilized in more Indie games and Unreal being mostly used by massive studios creating games that focus more on fidelity. 
This doesn't mean that Unity can't churn out high fedelity games or Unreal cannot produce amazing 2D games as both are perfectly capable. However, once you get started, you're going to get overwhelmed.
For a beginner, I would recommend the utilization of Unity, as many say the learning curve of Unity is less that of Unreal.

<h2>The Entire Process isn't Completely Linear</h2> 
<br>

<p> After you have an idea of what Engine you want to use, you then need to learn the quirks and features of the Engine. Unity is an engine that uses C# and runs off of C++ in the backend.
What does this mean? It means that you 'code' with C#, while Unity is based off of C++, so the experience is made to be as snappy as possible. While a recommended start point is to learn the 
language first and then move onto the Engine, the process is not linear. There is no deadline, and the main contributor to your first project is none other than you. Therefore you could start learning the 
language just for the sake of using it in the Engine and for nothing else. Now, I know this sounds weird to say but STAY MOTIVATED. Creating a game is mentally taxing and it can get really demotivating sometimes. 
Just power through it, and the finished product will be worth the amount of effort that you put in. Now, what I recommend for you is to watch and follow along with as many tutorials as you can on a free resource such as 
Youtube because many people who strive to be educators on a platform such as that are just as good as physical teachers. </p>

This is one of those Youtubers that will really help you with your GameDev career. Even though they no longer make videos, their tutorials are amazingly helpful and simple to follow, especially early on in your career. </a>

<p> Now that you're starting off your journey, I have a few tips in mind just to keep you sane throughout it. When you're first starting to prototype a game, make a build of the game that is as simple as possible to see if it's fun to you. 
If it isn't fun to the creator, the end product is not going to be fun whatsoever. Second of all, if you're just starting out, create a game that just functions with minimal bugs than aim to create something as complex as Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
Third, DO NOT PLAGIARISE WORK. No matter what, this is shunned upon. This doesn't mean that you can't use other people's code in your project but do not try to pass it on as your own. Finally, know what you're capable of and constrain to those limits.
You cannot create something like GTA 5 in a year by yourself and keep realistic goals. Now, what kind of games will you make?</p>
