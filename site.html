<h1> Starting off Your GameDev Career</h1>
<p> Something that really interested me as a kid was video games. I still play them to this day, but sometimes 
I spark an idea for one that may look really fun. I wasn't influential by any means so I thought I would try making my own.
There was a lot of struggle and I gave up a little, but the final product was created. Only to find out it wasn't as fun as 
I thought it was. But, it was my first game and making an insane one as your first should not be your priority. Learning is 
fine, and you need to hone your skills with other people to make a really polished game. </p>
