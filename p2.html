<p> After you have an idea of what Engine you want to use, you then need to learn the quirks and features of the Engine. Unity is an engine that uses C# and runs off of C++ in the backend.
What does this mean? It means that you 'code' with C#, while Unity is based off of C++, so the experience is made to be as snappy as possible. While a recommended start point is to learn the 
language first and then move onto the Engine, the process is not linear. There is no deadline, and the main contributor to your first project is none other than you. Therefore you could start learning the 
language just for the sake of using it in the Engine and for nothing else. Now, I know this sounds weird to say but STAY MOTIVATED. Creating a game is mentally taxing and it can get really demotivating sometimes. 
Just power through it, and the finished product will be worth the amount of effort that you put in. Now, what I recommend for you is to watch and follow along with as many tutorials as you can on a free resource such as 
Youtube because many people who strive to be educators on a platform such as that are just as good as physical teachers. </p>

This is one of those Youtubers that will really help you with your GameDev career. Even though they no longer make videos, their tutorials are amazingly helpful and simple to follow, especially early on in your career. </a>
