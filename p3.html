<p> Now that you're starting off your journey, I have a few tips in mind just to keep you sane throughout it. When you're first starting to prototype a game, make a build of the game that is as simple as possible to see if it's fun to you. 
If it isn't fun to the creator, the end product is not going to be fun whatsoever. Second of all, if you're just starting out, create a game that just functions with minimal bugs than aim to create something as complex as Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 
Third, DO NOT PLAGIARISE WORK. No matter what, this is shunned upon. This doesn't mean that you can't use other people's code in your project but do not try to pass it on as your own. Finally, know what you're capable of and constrain to those limits.
You cannot create something like GTA 5 in a year by yourself and keep realistic goals. Now, what kind of games will you make?</p>
